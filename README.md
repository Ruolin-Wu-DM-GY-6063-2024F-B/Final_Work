# Final_Work
Here are some ideas that I want to achieve as my final project. Some of it I asked ChatGPT how to accomplish them on the technical part.

1. An interactive art piece that changes visuals based on sound input (e.g., a microphone connected to Arduino).
   The reason why I think about this is because I use Iphone for roughly decades, and I can tell that in America people use Iphone more. I can recall that every year, it definitely be over 3 or 4 times thar siri would accidently pop-up because we said something same as that. Whether I'm saying chinese or english, this thing always happened. And it also remind me of some interesting things (not that appropriate though). <https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-common-Chinese-word-that-sounds-like-nigga-to-American-ears>
   I think I want to use a sound input that will detect the words in people's talking, maybe they are saying the words that is not the incentive one, but this is communication, the misunderstanding.

2. A narrative-driven system where users make choices that change the storyline or visuals
  Drawing from my experience designing an RPG game, this system allows users to influence the storyline through their choices. The focus isn't just on the aesthetics of the game interface but on how players interact with it. By secretly tracking the number of button presses, I plan to introduce hidden sub-stories, demonstrating that while choices may seem binary, they can lead to vastly different narrative outcomes.(But I'm a little bit afriad that there are too many "if" appear in my code)

3. Design a digital art tool where the pressure on force sensors controls brush size, color intensity, or pattern complexity on a canvas.
   Influenced by a student's use of shaders to express concepts in the mid-term, I hope I can use pressure from force sensors to control variables in shader functions, altering brush size, color intensity, or pattern complexity. Additionally, inspired by a recent performance art piece on the dynamics of dominance and submission, visualizing how pressure on skin can translate into sensations of pain or pleasure could offer a compelling exploration of physical and emotional interaction.
