# Final_Work
Here are some ideas that I want to achieve as my final project. Some of it I asked ChatGPT how to accomplish them on the technical part.

1. An interactive art piece that changes visuals based on sound input (e.g., a microphone connected to Arduino).
   The reason why I think about this is because I use Iphone for roughly decades, and I can tell that in America people use Iphone more. I can recall that every year, it definitely be over 3 or 4 times thar siri would accidently pop-up because we said something same as that. Whether I'm saying chinese or english, this thing always happened. And it also remind me of some interesting things (not that appropriate though). <https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-common-Chinese-word-that-sounds-like-nigga-to-American-ears>
   I think I want to use a sound input that will detect the words in people's talking, maybe they are saying the words that is not the incentive one, but this is communication, the misunderstanding.

2. A narrative-driven system where users make choices that change the storyline or visuals
  I designed a RPG game before, and what is interesting is not about how beautiful the game interface is (it matters!), but how can the player interact with the game really matters. Human can hardly remember the times when they push the bottom too much, I think I will secretly calculate the bottom times and pop up some interesting sub-story. And push the bottom also will change the storyline，the botton is binary, but within enough selection, the story can be completely different.(But I'm a little bit afriad that there are too many "if" appear in my code)
  
  
4. Design a digital art tool where the pressure on force sensors controls brush size, color intensity, or pattern complexity on a canvas.
   I like mid-term a student use Shaders as his way to convey concept, if I can utilize the pressure to control the 参数 from shader function, I think it would be cool. And also last week I went to a 行为艺术，关于施虐与受虐的，对他人的皮肤产生的压力如何转化为痛感或者快感，将它们可视化会非常有意思。
